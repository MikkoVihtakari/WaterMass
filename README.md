**Water mass classification, TS- and section plots using ggplot2 to aid
analysis of oceanographic data. R package version 0.1.0**

This package contains water mass classification, temperature-salinity-,
and section plot functions from
[PlotSvalbard](https://github.com/MikkoVihtakari/PlotSvalbard). These
functions are more up-to-date in this package, which may eventually be
usbmitted to CRAN.
